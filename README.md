# Creating-ground-truths-for-the-ultrasound-image
this is a technique used for making ground truths for nipple detection on a coronal plane of ultrasound image
firstly we import the original image (coronal view of breast ultrasound)
then we create a mask for one patient 
next we use create gt program to make the groundtruths
the ground truth made are in color and so we use color-to-black progrma to get exact groundtruth
